Readme with installation instructions for using the app with Docker, so it can be easily downloaded and run.  If the project can't be downloaded and run with a simple docker-compose up command then it will be rejected and you will automatically receive only 50 points for the project.   You must test your project so that it works and the installation instructions are correct.
